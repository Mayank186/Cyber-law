      <h3>Civil law is a body of rules that defines and protects the private rights of citizens, offers legal remedies 
          that may be sought in a dispute, and covers areas of law such as contracts, torts, property and family law. Civil law is 
          derived from the laws of ancient Rome which used doctrines to develop a code that determined how legal issues would be decided. 
          To explore this concept, consider the following civil law definition.</h3>
      <h3>The body of law that governs private or civil rights, providing redress for wrongs by compensating the person or
           entity that has been wronged rather than punishing the wrongdoer.</h3>

  <h2 style="font-family:arial;"><b>Types of civil law offenses</b></h2>
    
      <h4>Civil law cases are divided into four main categories, each covering a range of issues.  See below for the types 
          of civil cases and corresponding civil law examples.</h4>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
           <h3>Contract Law -</h3>
        <h4>Contract law deals with agreements between two or more parties, each of which is obligated to hold up their portion of the agreement.
             For example, two parties enter into an agreement for the lease of an apartment. The Lessor has the right to use the apartment,
              and the landlord receives rent money as compensation. If one party violates any of the provisions of the contract, they have
               committed a civil wrong known as “breach of contract.” Generally speaking, contracts may be oral or written, however there are
                certain types of contracts that must be put in writing.</h4>

                </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h3>Tort Law -</h3>
        <h4>Tort law is a branch of civil law that is concerned with personal injury and civil wrongdoing. 
            A tort is a civil wrong, done by one person or entity to another which results in injury or property damage, and
             frequently involves monetary compensation to the injured party. There are three categories of torts: negligence,
              intentional tort, and strict liability.</h4>
              <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li>
              Intentional tort -
              An intentional tort is a deliberate wrongdoing in which the defendant acted with intent to cause harm or injury.
               Some examples of intentional torts include: assault and battery, false imprisonment, fraud, invasion of privacy,
                and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Negligence - It is an unintentional tort, to which there are four elements that must be satisfied.
                </li>
                <li>
                Strict liability - It is a tort that does not require actual negligence or 
                intent to injure. It is based on an absolute or “strict” duty to ensure something is safe 
                </li>
                </ul>
        </div>

                </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h3>Property Law -</h3>
        <h4>Property law covers both personal property and real property. Personal property can be tangible, such as jewelry, 
        animals, and merchandise, or intangible such as patents, copyrights, stocks, and bonds. Real property refers to land and 
        anything built on it that cannot be easily removed, as well as anything under the surface of the land, such as oil and minerals. </h4>
        <h4>There are two types of property law torts: trespass and conversion:</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li>
              Trespass to chattels refers to a defendant intentionally and physically interfering with the plaintiff’s
               right to possession and use of their personal property. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Trespass to land occurs when a defendant enters plaintiff’s private property without consent of the plaintiff
                </li>
                <li>
                Conversion refers to a defendant depriving a plaintiff of their personal property without the plaintiff’s consent,
                 and then using the plaintiff’s property as his own.
                </li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4"><br><br>

                </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h3>Family Law -</h3>
        <h4>Family law is the branch of civil law that deals with marriage, divorce, annulment, child custody, adoption, birth, 
        child support, and any other issues affecting families. This branch of civil law is unique in that there is not necessarily 
        a person who committed a civil wrong. This is particularly true in states that have no-fault divorces. The family court gets
         involved with dividing up property and finances after a divorce, establishing child custody, child support, and spousal support
          among other things. Some newer areas that fall under the family law umbrella are same-sex marriage, artificial conception, surrogate
           motherhood, in vitro fertilization, and palimony.</h4>
