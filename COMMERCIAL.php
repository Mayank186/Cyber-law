      <h3>Commercial law is primarily regulated by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is a model
       set of laws regarding the sales of goods, leases of good, negotiable instruments, and secured transactions.
        All states have adopted some form of the UCC, though each state is free to make its own modifications to the 
        laws as it sees fit. Because many states have modified at least some of the UCC provisions to fit their needs,
         it is important to hire a lawyer familiar with the UCC as it has been enacted in your state.</h3>
      <h3>Legal rules that (1) determine the rights and duties of parties engaged in trade and commerce,
       (2) govern disputes arising out of ordinary transactions of buyers and sellers, and (3) settle issues concerned
